My idea is to combine both my final project of CS50x and CS50w by building an
engine in python and the building a interactive web page where users can use 
the engine to analyze postions

While evaluating, a chess engine looks at all pieces and ascertains the position 
that would be better for each. During this process, all chess engines display 
something called an eval.
